sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: it's really fast in a ordered set, but slow with random and reversed. Bubble Sort is the only of the 3 with Theta n.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: It's the fastest of the three in the random sets.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: it takes the same time for random and sorted sets, thus its theta is the same as its omega, which is true for the selection sort and merge sort, but merge is way faster.
