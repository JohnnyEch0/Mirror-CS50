Substitution Notes

1. get key from cmdl input
2. check if the key is valid
    is it 26(25) long?
    does it contain each letter once
    is there a non-alphabetic letter
    was there another arg given or was there non arg given -> printf
3. output: plaintext:(nonewline) - wait for input
4. change each letter in the input to the corresponding letter in the key
5. print the cyphertext



- key should be case insensitive
